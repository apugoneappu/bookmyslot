## How to use

1. Enter your mobile number and click the `Get OTP` button.  
Example: mobile number - `9876543210`
2. Enter the received OTP (6 digits)  
Example: OTP - `123456`
3. Enter the range of pincodes that you would like to book a vaccination centre in. In case of multiple available centres, the middle pincode is used to book the closest centre.  
Example: pincode_from - `556145`, pincode - `556150`, pincode_to - `556155`
4. (Optional) If you wish to book a slot for only some of the beneficiaries registered on CoWIN, enter their names here. If empty, BookMySlot will try to book for all valid beneficiaries registered on CoWIN.
Example: names - `Raju Goyal, Meena Singh, Hima Nain`
5. Select your state from the list of states.
6. Select your district(s) from the list of districts. To select more than one district, hold the control key while clicking them.
7. Click `Submit`
8. As soon as a vaccination appointment is available, a new window popup opens up to show a captcha image. To grab your attention quickly, BookMySlot will make a sound when the captcha is required.   <img height="200" alt="Screenshot 2021-05-13 at 7 45 02 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15952329/118070555-c6309780-b3c3-11eb-9105-dc653193d0cc.png">
9. Enter the captcha and press `OK`.     
10. If the booking is successful, a confirmation popup opens up with the details of the booking, such as person names, centre name, date of appointment etc.   <img width="372" alt="Screenshot 2021-05-12 at 5 37 44 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15952329/117899446-c312aa00-b2e4-11eb-8442-28a2daf5b8d9.png">
11. If the booking was unsuccessful for any reason (appointment slot filled before confirmation, incorrect captcha etc.), then BookMySlot will keep looking for more appointments.

## Making

Hi, my name is Apoorve Singhal. I made BookMySlot to automate the vaccine booking process for my family who were unable to book a slot due to their lack of proficiency with technology. I hope it will be helpful to other folks and gives them a chance to get vaccinated.
